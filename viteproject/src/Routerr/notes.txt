ðŸ§  Why we use BrowserRouter in main.tsx (or index.tsx):
In a React application, BrowserRouter is a component from React Router used to enable client-side routing.
It watches the browser's URL and renders the corresponding components without reloading the page.

 What BrowserRouter does:
It listens to URL changes.

Renders the right components based on the URL.

Prevents full page reloads for a faster, smoother experience.
